#Notes: Functions in Python are a collection of code to complete a task
# First begin with a key word, than give the function a name, followed by "():"
#Must make sure to indent the next line to stay in the function.
#Example 1:

def sayhi():
    print("Hello User")

# To call a function, call it's name followed by "()"
sayhi()
